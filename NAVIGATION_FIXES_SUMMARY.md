# Navigation and Authentication Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Login Navigation Issue
**Problem**: App wasn't navigating properly after successful login due to mixed authentication state management.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `AppNavigator.tsx` to use `AuthContext` instead of mixed contexts
- Fixed conditional navigation structure to properly handle authenticated/unauthenticated states
- Updated `LoginScreen.tsx` to use `AuthContext.login()` instead of `useAuthStore.signIn()`

### 2. ✅ SafeAreaView Layout Issue
**Problem**: Screen content was running out of bounds at the bottom on native implementations.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `ShopHomeScreen.tsx` SafeAreaView to include `bottom` edge: `edges={['top', 'left', 'right', 'bottom']}`

### 3. ✅ Guest Navigation Back to Login
**Problem**: No way to navigate back to login screen from guest browsing mode.

**Solution**: 
- Added back button in guest mode header with arrow-left icon
- Implemented conditional header layout based on `isGuestMode` state
- Updated header title and subtitle to reflect guest browsing context

### 4. ✅ Guest Wallet Balance Display
**Problem**: Mock wallet balance was showing for guest users instead of N/A.

**Solution**: 
- Updated wallet balance logic to show "N/A" for guest users
- Changed wallet button to show "Sign In" with lock icon for guests
- Modified wallet button styling and behavior for guest mode

### 5. ✅ Navigation Props and Types
**Problem**: TypeScript navigation prop issues between guest and authenticated screens.

**Solution**: 
- Updated navigation type definitions to support both `CustomerStackParamList` and `GuestStackParamList`
- Fixed type casting for guest navigation calls
- Improved navigation method calls with proper type safety

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
1. **`src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`**
   - Restructured navigation to properly handle auth state changes
   - Added proper logging for debugging
   - Fixed screen conditional rendering

2. **`src/screens/auth/LoginScreen.tsx`**
   - Switched from `useAuthStore` to `useAuth` context
   - Updated error handling and state management
   - Fixed login method calls

3. **`src/screens/shop/HomeScreen.tsx`**
   - Added guest mode detection and UI changes
   - Implemented back navigation for guests
   - Updated wallet balance display logic
   - Fixed SafeAreaView edges
   - Added proper styling for guest-specific elements

### Navigation Flow:
```
┌─────────────┐
│ Auth Screen │ ← Initial landing
└─────┬───────┘
      │
      ├─── Login Success ──→ Role-based Navigator (Customer/Partner/Driver/Admin)
      │
      └─── Browse as Guest ──→ Guest Navigator
                               ├─── Shop Home (with back button)
                               ├─── Product Details  
                               ├─── Guest Cart
                               └─── Auth Prompt (for restricted features)
```

## Testing Results

✅ **Authentication Flow**: Login successfully redirects to role-based screens
✅ **Guest Browsing**: Users can browse products without authentication  
✅ **Back Navigation**: Guest users can return to login screen
✅ **Wallet Display**: Shows "N/A" for guests, actual balance for authenticated users
✅ **SafeAreaView**: No layout overflow issues on native platforms
✅ **Type Safety**: All navigation props properly typed

## Remaining Minor Issues

⚠️ **Style Warning**: 'width' property not supported by native animated module (non-breaking)
- This is likely from the PriceRangeSlider component and doesn't affect functionality

## Next Steps

The app is now fully functional with proper authentication flow and guest browsing experience. All major navigation issues have been resolved and the app provides a seamless experience for both authenticated and guest users.
